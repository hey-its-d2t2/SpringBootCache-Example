<!--
        - name: Defines the name of the cache. In this case, "userCacheData"
                is the identifier for this cache, which aligns with the @Cacheable annotation in your service.

        - maxEntriesLocalHeap: Sets the maximum number of entries that can be stored in the heap (memory).
                                Here, itâ€™s set to 100, meaning the cache can store up to 100 items in memory.

        - eternal: If set to false, it means that cached items will eventually expire.
                   Setting it to true would keep cache entries forever unless manually evicted.

        - timeToIdleSeconds: Defines the time (in seconds) that an entry can remain in the cache without being accessed.
                            After 120 seconds of inactivity, the cache entry will be eligible for eviction.

        - timeToLiveSeconds: Specifies the maximum time (in seconds) an entry can remain in the cache,
                                regardless of access. After 600 seconds, the entry will be removed from the cache.

        - memoryStoreEvictionPolicy: Determines the policy for evicting entries from the cache when it reaches its maximum capacity.
                                    LRU (Least Recently Used) means that when the cache is full, the least recently accessed entry will be the first to be removed.
